### What is Drip?

Drip is an Inversion of Control (IoC) container written in PHP4 and
inspired by [Copland](http://copland.rubyforge.org). In a nutshell,
it allows you to simplify the instantiation and initialization of
your classes.

Inversion of Control, also known as IoC, is a relatively new
concept that has been made popular by the
[Spring Application Framework](http://www.springframework.org) and
can be used to reduce coupling inherent in computer programs. As
[Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com)
[points out](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html), the
term 'Inversion of Control' is a poorly-chosen one. Still, it is
the one that most people know the concept by, so it will be used
throughout the documentation.

As of now there are no other IoC containers for PHP4 beside Drip.

### What can Drip do for you?

Ultimately, it can reduce the amount of code that you have to
write, simplifying some common programming tasks for you. This has
the two-fold benefit of both decreasing application development
time, and of decreasing the effort needed to maintain your
application.

Specifically, Drip features:

-   Reference Another Service
-   Service Configuration
-   ???

### What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?

-   Drip was written especially for PHP4.
-   Package descriptor files are YAML-formatted.
-   ...
